## Dark Mode - Introduction

In today's digital world, users often spend extended hours interacting with screens. Dark mode has emerged as a popular solution, offering a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments. Beyond user comfort, dark mode has demonstrably positive impacts on battery life and can even contribute to better sleep patterns. This blog will guide you through implementing a user-friendly dark mode feature within your Next.js web application, equipping you with the tools to enhance user experience and cater to modern preferences.

## Why It Matters

- **Reduced Eye Strain:** Dark mode minimizes bright light emission, alleviating eye fatigue, headaches, and dry eyes.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Dark mode enhances readability and contrast for users with visual impairments or light sensitivity.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Dark mode extends battery life and reduces energy consumption, especially on devices with OLED displays.
- **Enhanced Visual Appeal:** Dark mode offers a sleek and immersive aesthetic, making applications more visually appealing.
- **Reduced Screen Glare:** Dark mode minimizes screen glare in brightly lit environments, improving usability and reducing distractions.

## Installation

### Install the next-themes package:

```bash
npm install next-themes
```

## Setup and Usage

### 2. Wrap layout.tsx with ThemeProvider component

```tsx
// layout.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang='en' suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className='bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-900'>
        <ThemeProvider
          attribute='class'
          defaultTheme='system'
          enableSystem={true}
          disableTransitionOnChange
        >
          <main>{children}</main>
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 3. Add darkMode to tailwind.config.js

```tsx
// tailwind.config.js
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

const config: Config = {
  darkMode: 'class',
};
export default config;
```

### 4. Create a switch to toggle themes

```tsx
// ThemeToggle.tsx

'use client';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';
// import svg icons

export function ThemeToggle() {
  const { resolvedTheme, setTheme } = useTheme();
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    setLoaded(true);
  }, [setLoaded]);

  return (
    <button
      aria-label='Toggle Dark Mode'
      type='button'
      className='fixed bottom-10 right-4 z-50 rounded-xl bg-white p-2 shadow-lg md:right-10'
      onClick={() => setTheme(resolvedTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
    >
        {loaded ? (
          resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? (
            // add your dark svg ICON here
          ) : (
            // add your light svg ICON here
          )
        ) : (
          <>
            // add your loading svg ICON here to avoid layout shift
          </>
        )}
      </svg>
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 5. Add ThemeToggle component to layout.tsx

```tsx
// layout.tsx

<ThemeToggle />
```

## Explanation

Option for ThemeProvider:

- defaultTheme = 'system' (based on prefers-color-scheme)

## Mastering React Testing with Vitest 2.0: A Comprehensive Guide Part 2

In the first part of this guide, we set up Vitest 2.0 and wrote basic tests for React components. In this second part, we'll delve into testing React applications that utilize React Router. We'll cover how to test routing, navigation, and dynamic routes to ensure that your application's routing logic is functioning correctly.

If you haven't read the first part of this series, I highly recommend checking it out [here](/blog/testing-react-vitest) to get up to speed with the basics of Vitest 2.0 and React component testing.

## Why Test Routing?

Testing routing is crucial for several reasons:

- Ensures components render correctly for specific routes
- Verifies navigation interactions work as expected
- Tests dynamic routes and route parameters
- Handles redirects and conditional rendering based on authentication or other conditions

By thoroughly testing your routing logic, you can catch bugs early and prevent issues related to navigation in your React applications.

## Setting Up React Router in Your Application

First things first, let's make sure React Router is properly set up in your project.

### 1. Install React Router

To install React Router, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 2. Create Routes

Next, define the routes in your application. You can create a new file, such as `Routes.tsx`, to manage your routes. Here's an example of how you can set up routes using React Router:

```tsx title="Routes.tsx"
// Routes.tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path='/' exact component={Home} />
        <Route path='/about' component={About} />
        <Route path='/contact' component={Contact} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default Routes;
```

### 3. Add Routes to Your App

Finally, import the `Routes` component in your `App.tsx` file and render it within your application:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
// App.tsx
import Routes from './Routes';

const App = () => {
  return <Routes />;
};

export default App;
```

With React Router set up, you can now start writing tests for components that use routing and navigation logic.

## Testing React Router Components with Vitest 2.0

We already have Vitest 2.0 set up in our project from the previous guide. Now, let's write tests for components that use React Router. We'll cover testing routes, navigation, and dynamic routes using Vitest 2.0 and React Testing Library.

### 1. Create a Custom Render Function

Create a `test-utils.tsx` file to define a custom render function that wraps components with the necessary routing context:

```tsx title="test-utils.tsx"
// test-utils.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const renderWithRouter = (ui: React.ReactNode, { route = '/' } = {}) => {
  return render(<MemoryRouter initialEntries={[route]}>{ui}</MemoryRouter>);
};

export { renderWithRouter };
```

### 2. Write Tests for Routes

Create a new test file, such as `Routes.test.tsx`, to test the routes in your application:

```tsx title="Routes.test.tsx"
// Routes.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import Routes from './Routes';

describe('Routes', () => {
  test('renders home page at "/"', () => {
    renderWithRouter(<Routes />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Home')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('renders about page at "/about"', () => {
    renderWithRouter(<Routes />, { route: '/about' });
    expect(screen.getByText('About')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('renders contact page at "/contact"', () => {
    renderWithRouter(<Routes />, { route: '/contact' });
    expect(screen.getByText('Contact')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 3. Write Tests for Navigation

Create a new test file, as `Navigation.test.tsx`, to test navigation interactions:

```tsx title="Navigation.test.tsx"
// Navigation.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { userEvent } from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import App from './App';

describe('Navigation', () => {
  test('navigates to about page when About link is clicked', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    renderWithRouter(<App />);
    const aboutLink = screen.getByText('About');
    await user.click(aboutLink);
    expect(screen.getByText('About Page')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('navigates to contact page when Contact link is clicked', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    renderWithRouter(<App />);
    const contactLink = screen.getByText('Contact');
    await user.click(contactLink);
    expect(screen.getByText('Contact Page')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('navigates to the home page', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    renderWithRouter(<App />);
    const homeLink = screen.getByText('Home');
    await user.click(homeLink);
    expect(screen.getByText('Home')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 4. Write Tests for Dynamic Routes

Create a new test file, such as `DynamicRoute.test.tsx`, to test dynamic routes:

```tsx title="DynamicRoute.test.tsx"
// DynamicRoute.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

describe('Dynamic Routes', () => {
  test('renders user profile with correct id', () => {
    renderWithRouter(
      <Route path='/user/:id'>
        <UserProfile />
      </Route>,
      { route: '/user/123' },
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('User Profile: 123')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 5. Write Tests for Redirects

Create a new test file, such as `Redirects.test.tsx`, to test redirects:

```tsx title="Redirects.test.tsx"
// Redirects.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import { Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';

describe('Redirects', () => {
  test('redirects to login page when accessing a protected route', () => {
    renderWithRouter(
      <Route path='/protected' render={() => <Redirect to='/login' />} />,
      { route: '/protected' },
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('Login Page')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 6. Write Tests for Conditional Rendering

Create a new test file, such as `ConditionalRendering.test.tsx`, to test conditional rendering based on authentication or other conditions:

```tsx title="ConditionalRendering.test.tsx"
// ConditionalRendering.test.tsx
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import { MemoryRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

test('renders private component when authenticated', () => {
  const { getByText } = renderWithRouter(
    <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/private']}>
      <Route path='/private' render={() => <div>Private</div>} />
    </MemoryRouter>,
  );
  expect(getByText('Private')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test('redirects to login page when not authenticated', () => {
  const { getByText } = renderWithRouter(
    <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/private']}>
      <Route path='/private' render={() => <div>Private</div>} />
    </MemoryRouter>,
  );
  expect(getByText('Login')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Advanced Testing Techniques

Now that we've covered the basics, let's explore some advanced techniques to make your tests even more robust.

### Testing with Query Parameters

Query parameters are often used to pass data between routes.
Query parameters can be a bit tricky to test, but with the right setup, you can make it work.

```tsx title="QueryParams.test.tsx"
// QueryParams.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults';

describe('Query Parameters', () => {
  test('renders search results based on query parameter', () => {
    renderWithRouter(<SearchResults />, { route: '/search?q=react' });
    expect(screen.getByText('Search results for: react')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Testing Route Guards

Route guards are used to protect routes from unauthorized access.

```tsx title="RouteGuards.test.tsx"
// RouteGuards.test.tsx
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderWithRouter } from './test-utils';
import PrivateRoute from './PrivateRoute';

const mockAuthCheck = jest.fn();

describe('Route Guards', () => {
  test('allows access to authenticated user', () => {
    mockAuthCheck.mockReturnValue(true);
    renderWithRouter(
      <PrivateRoute path='/dashboard' component={() => <div>Dashboard</div>} />,
      { route: '/dashboard' },
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('Dashboard')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('redirects unauthenticated user to login', () => {
    mockAuthCheck.mockReturnValue(false);
    renderWithRouter(
      <PrivateRoute path='/dashboard' component={() => <div>Dashboard</div>} />,
      { route: '/dashboard' },
    );
    expect(screen.getByText('Login Page')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
